# php-json-xml
My first php script

With the objective to get started in PHP i've programmed this script that works with JSON and XML data. It's simple and will contain errors but i only want to learn about it by the moment.

# How it works

First, the script gets the remote ip from visitor. Then uses "ip-api.com" to get the city and this is the search parameter introduced in the flickr api like tag. The result is the last ten posted photos with the city tag. In parallel, the program provides the ability to search by tag.

This is the normal work of the app but if the first request of ip is not valid because is running in local or something like this will provides the manually entering of the tag.
